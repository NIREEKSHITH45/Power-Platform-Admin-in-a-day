#### Hands-on lab

## Lab Scenario

In this Hands-on Lab, you are an administrator helping adopt the Power Platform.

An important part of keeping the Power Platform running successfully is monitoring the ongoing usage. In this hands-on lab, you will be using the platform tools and the COE Starter Kit to 
perform usage monitoring.

## Lab Test Environment

This lab is designed to be completed in an environment setup for multiple students to complete the Admin in a day series of hands-on labs.

You need to use the assigned user and environment information to complete this lab. You must have completed the prior labs to complete this lab.

## Exercise 1: Explore the out-of-the-box analytics

   ![](images/M02/tenant-save1.png)

   >**Note**: Once enabled, this feature aggregates data from environments across all regions in your tenant and copies it into the default environment region for tenant-level reporting. A tenant-level administrator role is required for the one-time operation of granting consent for tenant-level analytics.

5. The Overview tab displays a message indicating that tenant-level analytics has been enabled. Typically, these reports are displayed within 24-48 hours of enabling the feature.

## Exercise 3: Setup the CoE Starter Kit Power BI Dashboard

### Scenario

In this exercise, you will explore some of the apps and analytics that are part of the Power Platform CoE Starter Kit. We have already installed and configured the starter kit for the 
tenant you are using for this lab. As part of configuring, we imported the solution, shared the apps, configured the flows that synchronize data and published the Power BI report. If you 
were doing this with your tenant, you would follow the instructions to complete these steps.

Now in this exercise, you will explore the following key components:

- Power Platform Admin View app
- Power BI Dashboard
- The business process that is used by the Developer Compliance process.

### Task 1: Explore the Power Platform Admin View app

   provide your risk assessment. You can also tag the app to show in the App Catalog and make it featured. You can customize the CoE entities to add additional fields here if needed.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX3-T1-S7.png)

8. Select **Environments** in the left navigation. This will show you a list of all the environments in your tenant and key metrics like several apps. To view all your environments,

## Exercise 4: Perform a risk assessment of overshared resources

### Scenario

We were going to perform a risk assessment to look for apps that have been shared with your tenant. To accomplish this, you are going to use the Power BI report that you just published 
to look for apps that are over-shared.

### Task 1: Locate Overshared Apps

1. Navigate to the Power BI report you just published.

2. Select the **Apps** page in the report.

3. Select the Show navigation button and select **Apps Risk Assessment**. This will take you to the risk assessment page of the report.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX4-T1-S3.png)

4. The list of apps you'll see now is the ones that qualify for the default criteria. We want to focus on the ones that have been shared with the entire organization and validate that 
   they are appropriate.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX4-T1-S4.png)

5. In the filter panel, select True in the Shared with Everyone section.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX4-T1-S5.png)

6. The filter will take place immediately and you will see a small list of apps that have been shared with everyone. In many cases, a quick evaluation of the name of the app would 
   indicate whether it was appropriate, but it also allows you to drill down into more details by hovering your mouse pointer over the name of the app. You might also use the owner’s 
   name to contact the person who made the app to get more details to determine if it was appropriate to share with everyone.


## Exercise 5: How much is a connector used in your

## organization

### Scenario

Using the Power BI report, you can easily see what apps and flows are using a connector. In this exercise, you will find out who is using the SharePoint connector.

### Task 1: Locate resources that use the SharePoint connector

1. Navigate to the Power BI report you just published.

2. Select the **App Connections** page in the report.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX5-T1-S2.png)

3. In the filter panel, in the **Connector** section search for **Office 365 Outlook** and select it.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX5-T1-S3.png)

4. The page will now filter on makers, and apps that use Office 365.

5. Using this you could evaluate things like the impact of changing DLP policies or other governance or training that might be needed related to a connector.


## Exercise 6: Review tenant audit logs (Optional if you have time)

### Scenario

All other auditing of Power Apps and Power Automate flows (other than CDS data modification) are viewed through the Microsoft Purview site.

Before use, this must be enabled by a global tenant administrator using these instructions. In the tenant you are using we have already completed that for you as well as permitting you to view the audit log data for the tenant. That was done using the PowerShell command Add-RoleGroupMember “Compliance Management” -Member your user.

In this exercise, you will be using the log search and alert tools to work with the audit data.

### Task 1: Review audit logging in the environment

1. Navigate to https://compliance.microsoft.com/.

2. Locate and select **Audit** on the left side navigation.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S2.png)

3. Select **Search** using the default search criteria.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S3.png)

4. Select **Start Search**.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S4.png)

5. The **Job Status** will read as **Queued** once it has been set to process. **Refresh** the audit every few minutes or so until the status reads as **Completed**.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S5.png)

6. Select the Search name, which defaults to the audit date if no name has been inputted.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S6.png)

7. Review the items displayed; drill into a few of them to see the type of data available.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S7.png)

8. Select **Export** if you’d like to download the data for later viewing. Using export, you can open the data in other tools for analysis.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S8.png)

9. The export will begin and may take some time to complete.

    ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S9.png)

10. Select **Audit search** breadcrumb at the top of the page to navigate back to the search. This will not interrupt the export.

    ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S10.png)

11. Select the **Activities** dropdown and select all Power Apps and Power Automate activities.

    ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S11.png)

12. Select **Search** again and review the results once the status is Completed.

13. Look for an activity of Edited Flow, and select the item to open the detail. Review what data is provided.

14. A common task is to look at all of the activity for a particular user. Copy the user from this Edited flow activity and go back to the Audit search.

15. Paste the user you copied into the Users filter and select search again. Now you are looking at all the activity for a single user.

16. Try selecting an item to view detail. Copy the Item field and then go back to the list and select the filter results. Paste the item info you just copied into the file. The results 
    list will now only show activities related to that item. For example, you could use this to show all activities for a specific flow.


**Note:** Any information from before auditing was enabled, cannot be retrieved. This can be seen by selecting a date range from before the auditing was enabled.

## Exercise 7: Get notification of new apps, flows and connectors (Optional if you have time)

### Scenario

In this exercise, you will be using one of the pre-built Power Automate templates that runs on a schedule looks for newly created canvas apps, flows and connectors and sends you an 
email.

### Task 1: Create the flow from the template

1. Navigate to **https://make.powerautomate.com/** and sign in.

2. Make sure **Power Platform COE** environment is selected. Note: This environment is where the CoE starter kit is installed and is intended to be our dedicated admin environment. Even 
   if you don’t use the starter kit, having a dedicated admin environment can be helpful.
